# dstservercommands
Menu-driven program to issue server-side commands to dedicated DST server

What you can do so far:
- Give items to a player
- Set player statistics
  - Health (percent)
  - Hunger (percent)
  - Sanity (percent)
  - Moisture (percent)
  - Temperature (level)
  - Godmode (toggle on/off)
  - Supergodmode (toggle on/off)
  - Speed multiplier
- Set the season
- Make it rain!! :)
- Make it stop raining (lame)
- Regenerate world (untested)
- Generate a list of prefabs (this is a python script and I haven't really tested it that much but I may use it for something later)

What I'd like to do:
- Add support for giving a player prototypes
- Add "recipes" so instead of giving one item at a time, give groupings of recipes
- Add ability to skip (fast-forward) time
- Reveal the whole map and remove fog of war (http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/71460-found-console-command-to-reveal-whole-map-for-all-players-anewreignbeta/)
- Implement random stuff from this page: http://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Console/Don't_Starve_Together_Commands
